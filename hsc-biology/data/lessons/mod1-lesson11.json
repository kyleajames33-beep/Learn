Additionally, histone proteins are synthesised to package the new DNA, and centrosome duplication begins in preparation for cell division.",
      "Interphase occupies the majority of the cell cycle because the cell must complete several critical processes before division. During G1, the cell grows and duplicates organelles. During S phase, DNA replication must occur accurately, which requires significant time to ensure faithful copying of the entire genome. During G2, the cell synthesises proteins needed for mitosis (such as tubulin for spindle fibres) and performs quality control checks to verify DNA integrity. These preparation steps are essential for producing healthy daughter cells."
