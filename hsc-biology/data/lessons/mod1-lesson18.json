      "The red blood cell has a biconcave disc shape, which provides a large surface area relative to its volume. This shape maximises the surface area available for gas exchange, allowing efficient diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the cell membrane. Additionally, mature red blood cells lack a nucleus and most other organelles, which creates more space inside the cell for haemoglobin molecules, the protein that carries oxygen. This adaptation maximises the oxygen-carrying capacity of each cell.",
      "Pancreatic cells that secrete digestive enzymes have abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus compared to skin cells. The rough ER is essential for synthesising the large quantities of protein enzymes that pancreatic cells produce. The Golgi apparatus is then responsible for modifying, packaging, and sorting these enzymes for secretion. This high abundance of secretory pathway organelles reflects the pancreatic cell's specialised function of producing and exporting proteins, whereas skin cells primarily serve a protective function and therefore do not require such extensive protein synthesis and secretion machinery."
