      "In animal cells, cytokinesis occurs by the formation of a cleavage furrow, where actin microfilaments contract to pinch the cell membrane inward, dividing the cytoplasm into two daughter cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the centre of the cell as vesicles from the Golgi apparatus fuse together, depositing cell wall material. This cell plate grows outward to meet the existing cell walls, separating the two daughter cells. The difference exists because plant cells have rigid cell walls that prevent the pinching mechanism used by animal cells.",
      "Mitosis is essential for the growth of multicellular organisms because it allows a single-celled zygote to develop into a complex organism by producing genetically identical daughter cells. For repair, mitosis replaces damaged or dead cells, such as skin cells after injury, blood cells, and the gut lining which is replaced approximately every five days. The genetic identity of daughter cells ensures that new cells have the same functions as those they replace, maintaining tissue integrity and organism health."
