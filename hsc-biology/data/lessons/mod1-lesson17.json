      "Cystic fibrosis results from a mutation in the CFTR gene, which codes for a chloride channel protein in epithelial cell membranes. This channel normally transports chloride ions out of cells. When defective, chloride transport is impaired, which disrupts the normal osmotic movement of water (osmosis). Less water leaves the cells, causing the mucus outside the cells to become thick and dehydrated. This thick mucus blocks airways (causing breathing difficulties and infections) and pancreatic ducts (causing digestive problems).",
      "Cell cycle checkpoints normally act as surveillance mechanisms that ensure DNA is undamaged and the cell is ready before allowing division to proceed. If checkpoints fail (such as mutations in p53), cells with DNA damage can continue through the cell cycle and divide uncontrollably. These cells accumulate more mutations, divide rapidly without regulation, and can form tumours. The failure of checkpoints removes the 'quality control' that normally prevents damaged cells from proliferating."
