      "Simple diffusion is the movement of small, non-polar molecules (such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and lipids) directly through the phospholipid bilayer without the help of proteins. Facilitated diffusion is the movement of polar, charged, or large molecules (such as glucose and ions) that cannot cross the lipid bilayer on their own. These molecules require channel proteins or carrier proteins to assist their movement across the membrane. Both processes move substances down their concentration gradient and do not require ATP.",
      "Active transport is necessary for root hair cells because the concentration of mineral ions in the soil water is lower than inside the root hair cells. This means minerals must be absorbed against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to high concentration. Moving substances against their gradient requires energy in the form of ATP. Additionally, specific carrier proteins (pumps) are needed to bind and transport these ions across the membrane. Without active transport, the plant would be unable to accumulate sufficient minerals for growth."
