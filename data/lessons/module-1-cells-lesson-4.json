          "1 mark: Rigid cell wall resists pressure keeping cell firm"
        ],
        "modelAnswer": "The central vacuole maintains turgor pressure by accumulating water via osmosis, causing it to expand. This expansion pushes the cytoplasm against the rigid cell wall. The cell wall resists this outward pressure, creating turgor pressure that keeps the plant cell firm and the whole plant upright. When water is lost, turgor pressure drops and the plant wilts."

          "2 marks per difference (structure + functional significance) × 3 differences"

        "modelAnswer": "(1) Cell wall: Plant cells have a rigid cellulose cell wall providing structural support and protection against osmotic lysis; animal cells lack this, allowing greater flexibility. (2) Chloroplasts: Plants contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, making them autotrophic; animals lack chloroplasts and must obtain energy by consuming other organisms. (3) Large central vacuole: Plants have a prominent vacuole that stores water and maintains turgor pressure for rigidity; animals have small, temporary vacuoles focused on transport rather than support. These differences reflect plants' sessile, photosynthetic lifestyle versus animals' mobile, heterotrophic existence."
