These tenets are considered scientific facts because they have been consistently supported by over 150 years of observation and experimentation.</p><div class='table-wrap'><table><thead><tr><th>Tenet</th><th>Statement</th><th>What It Means</th><th>Evidence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>1</strong></td><td>All living organisms are composed of one or more cells</td><td>Every living thing—from bacteria to blue whales—is made of cells. No exceptions have ever been found.</td><td>Microscopic examination of all life forms; cell culture studies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2</strong></td><td>The cell is the basic unit of structure and organisation in organisms</td><td>Cells are the smallest unit that can carry out all life processes. Tissues, organs, and organ systems are built from cells.</td><td>Histology; tissue culture; developmental biology</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3</strong></td><td>All cells come from pre-existing cells</td><td>New cells arise only through division of existing cells. Life does not spontaneously generate from non-living matter.</td><td>Cell division observation (mitosis/meiosis); Pasteur's experiments</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class='highlight-box'><strong>⚠️ Common Misconception:</strong> Some students think cell theory states 'all cells are identical' or 'all cells are microscopic.' Neither is true! Cells vary enormously in size (nerve cells can be over 1 metre long) and structure (compare a root hair cell to a muscle cell).</div><div class='worked-example'><h4>📝 Worked Example: Applying the Tenets</h4><p><strong>Question:</strong> A student argues that mitochondria should be considered the basic unit of life because they carry out respiration. Use cell theory to evaluate this claim.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> According to tenet 2, the <em>cell</em> is the basic unit of structure and organisation. While mitochondria perform crucial functions, they cannot survive or reproduce independently outside a cell. They depend on the cellular environment for proteins, raw materials, and protection. Therefore, mitochondria are organelles, not the basic unit of life. The cell remains the smallest unit that can carry out all life processes independently.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='card-header'><div class='card-icon'>⚖️</div><h2>Living, Non-Living, and Dead</h2></div><p>Cell theory provides a powerful framework for distinguishing between living organisms, non-living things, and dead matter. This distinction is crucial in biology, medicine, and even space exploration (searching for life on other planets).</p><div class='table-wrap'><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Characteristics</th><th>Examples</th><th>Cell Theory Application</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>LIVING</strong></td><td>Made of cells; cells carry out metabolism; can reproduce; respond to stimuli; maintain homeostasis</td><td>Bacteria, plants, animals, fungi, protists</td><td>Fits all three tenets; composed of functional cells</td></tr><tr><td><strong>NON-LIVING</strong></td><td>Never had cells; no metabolism; cannot reproduce; no response to stimuli</td><td>Rocks, water, air, plastic, viruses*</td><td>Not composed of cells; lacks cellular organisation</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DEAD</strong></td><td>Was once living; had cells that are now non-functional; no metabolism or reproduction</td><td>Wood, hair, nails, fossilised bone</td><td>Once met all tenets; cells no longer functional</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class='warning-box'><strong>🚫 Exam Trap:</strong> Viruses are a special case—they are <em>acellular</em> (not made of cells) and cannot reproduce independently. Most biologists classify them as non-living, though they can evolve and carry genetic material. This makes viruses exceptions to standard cell theory.</div><div class='worked-example'><h4>📝 Worked Example: Classification</h4><p><strong>Question:</strong> Classify each of the following as living, non-living, or dead. Justify using cell theory.</p><p><strong>(a) A seed that has not yet germinated</strong><br>Living. The seed contains living embryonic cells in a dormant state. Under the right conditions, these cells will divide and grow—fulfilling all three tenets.</p><p><strong>(b) A wooden table</strong><br>Dead. The wood was once part of a living tree with functional cells. The cells are now dead—their structures remain but they carry out no metabolic processes.</p><p><strong>(c) A bacterial spore</strong><br>Living. The spore contains dormant bacterial cells. It is metabolically inactive but can resume active life when conditions improve. The cells are alive, just in suspended animation.</p></div></div><div class='card'><div class='card-header'><div class='card-icon'>🧬</div><h2>Evidence Supporting Cell Theory</h2></div><p>Cell theory is not just a collection of ideas—it is supported by overwhelming evidence from multiple fields of biology. Understanding this evidence strengthens our confidence in the theory and helps us apply it correctly.</p><h3>Lines of Evidence</h3><div class='table-wrap'><table><thead><tr><th>Type of Evidence</th><th>What It Shows</th><th>How It Supports Cell Theory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Microscopy</strong></td><td>All examined organisms contain cells</td><td>Direct visual confirmation of tenet 1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cell Culture</strong></td><td>Isolated cells can survive and divide in laboratory conditions</td><td>Cells function independently; new cells come from existing ones</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Developmental Biology</strong></td><td>Embryos develop from single cells (zygotes) through cell division</td><td>All cells in an organism trace back to one original cell</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Histology</strong></td><td>Tissues are composed of cells arranged in specific patterns</td><td>Cell is the basic unit of structure (tenet 2)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pasteur's Experiments</strong></td><td>Life does not spontaneously generate from broth</td><td>Cells must come from pre-existing cells (tenet 3)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class='info-box'><strong>💡 Modern Extensions:</strong> While the classical cell theory has three tenets, modern biology has added important concepts: (1) Cells contain hereditary information (DNA) passed during division, (2) All cells have similar chemical composition and metabolic processes, and (3) Energy flow occurs within cells.</div></div><div class='card'><div class='card-header'><div class='card-icon'>❓</div><h2>The Viral Exception</h2></div><p>Viruses present a fascinating challenge to cell theory. They are <em>acellular</em>—not made of cells—yet they exhibit some characteristics of life. This makes them valuable exceptions that help us refine our understanding of what 'life' means.</p><div class='table-wrap'><table><thead><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Viruses</th><th>Living Cells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cellular structure</strong></td><td>No cells; protein coat + genetic material</td><td>Enclosed by membrane; organelles present</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Metabolism</strong></td><td>No metabolic processes</td><td>Carries out respiration, synthesis, etc.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reproduction</strong></td><td>Only inside host cells (hijacks machinery)</td><td>Independent division (mitosis/meiosis)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Response to stimuli</strong></td><td>No response</td><td>Responds to environment</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Evolution</strong></td><td>Genetic material mutates; evolves over time</td><td>Evolution through natural selection</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class='highlight-box'><strong>⚠️ HSC Exam Strategy:</strong> When asked about viruses, always acknowledge they challenge cell theory by being acellular, but note they can only reproduce using cellular machinery.
