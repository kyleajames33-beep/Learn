        "question": "Antibiotics such as tetracycline are effective against bacteria because they:",
        "correctAnswer": "B - Target the 70S ribosomes",
        "explanation": "Selective toxicity is the principle here. Bacterial ribosomes are 70S (50S + 30S subunits) while human ribosomes are 80S (60S + 40S subunits). Tetracycline binds to the 30S subunit and blocks protein synthesis in bacteria. Human ribosomes are unaffected because their different structure prevents antibiotic binding."

        "question": "Distinguish between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells with reference to the presence of a nucleus and the structure of ribosomes. (2 marks)",
        "correctAnswer": "Prokaryotic cells have a nucleoid region (not surrounded by a membrane) whereas eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus (1 mark). Prokaryotes have 70S ribosomes which are smaller than the 80S ribosomes found in eukaryotes (1 mark).",
        "explanation": "Full marks require clear distinction on both criteria. Note that 'nucleoid' must be described as lacking a membrane. For ribosomes, mentioning the Svedberg values (70S vs 80S) or simply stating prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller earns the mark."

        "questionId": "sa-2",
        "question": "Explain why bacterial cells can be killed by antibiotics that target their ribosomes, while human cells are not affected. (2 marks)",
        "correctAnswer": "Bacterial cells have 70S ribosomes which have a different structure from the 80S ribosomes in human cells (1 mark). Antibiotics like tetracycline can bind to the 70S ribosomes and block protein synthesis in bacteria, but they cannot bind to the larger 80S ribosomes in human cells, so protein synthesis in human cells is not affected. This is called selective toxicity (1 mark).",
        "explanation": "The key concept is selective toxicity—exploiting structural differences. The answer must mention 70S vs 80S ribosomes and explain that the antibiotic can bind to bacterial but not human ribosomes. The term 'selective toxicity' is excellent but not essential if the concept is clearly explained."
