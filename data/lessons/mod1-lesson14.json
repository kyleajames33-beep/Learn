      "Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into cell types from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), meaning they can potentially form any cell type in the body, but they cannot form placental or extraembryonic tissues. Multipotent stem cells are more limited; they can differentiate into multiple cell types but only within a specific lineage or family. For example, haematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow can form various blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets) but cannot form nerve cells or muscle cells.",
      "Differentiated cells such as skin cells and nerve cells contain the same DNA because they originated from the same zygote through mitosis. However, they have different structures and functions because of differential gene expression. During differentiation, specific genes are switched on or off through epigenetic mechanisms. For example, skin cells express genes for producing keratin (structural protein), while nerve cells express genes for producing neurotransmitters and ion channels. This selective gene expression produces different proteins, leading to different cell structures and specialised functions, even though all cells retain the complete genome."
