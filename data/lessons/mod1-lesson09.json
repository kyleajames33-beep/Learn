Glucose, however, is a large, polar molecule that cannot cross the lipid bilayer on its own because the hydrophobic core repels polar substances. Therefore, glucose requires channel proteins or carrier proteins to assist its movement across the membrane in a process called facilitated diffusion.",
      "Two structural adaptations of the alveoli that maximise gas exchange are: (1) They have a very large total surface area due to the large number of alveoli (approximately 300 million in human lungs), which increases the rate of diffusion according to Fick's Law. (2) The alveolar walls and capillary walls are extremely thin (only one cell thick), which minimises the diffusion distance and therefore increases the rate of gas exchange."
