    "content": "In 1984, Alec Jeffreys developed DNA fingerprinting—a technique that would revolutionise forensic science. Since then, biotechnology has solved crimes, produced life-saving medicines like insulin, created drought-resistant crops, and even helped identify victims of disasters. The cellular biology you've learned is the foundation of these transformative technologies."

The process involves three steps repeated in cycles:</p><ul><li><strong>Denaturation (95°C):</strong> Heat separates the double-stranded DNA into single strands.</li><li><strong>Annealing (50-65°C):</strong> Primers bind to specific target sequences on the DNA template.</li><li><strong>Extension (72°C):</strong> DNA polymerase synthesises new DNA strands starting from the primers.</li></ul><p>Each cycle doubles the DNA amount, so 30 cycles produce over 1 billion copies. PCR is essential for DNA sequencing, forensics, disease diagnosis, and ancient DNA analysis.</p>"
