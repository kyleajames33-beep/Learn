      "Light microscopy has a maximum resolution of approximately 200 nm, limited by the wavelength of visible light. Electron microscopy (TEM) achieves much higher resolution of about 0.2 nm. Sample preparation for light microscopy is simple - specimens can be live or dead, and may be stained with dyes like methylene blue to increase contrast. Electron microscopy requires complex preparation: specimens must be dead, fixed with chemicals to preserve structure, dehydrated, and for TEM, embedded in resin and cut into ultra-thin sections (50-100 nm) before staining with heavy metals. SEM requires coating the specimen with a thin layer of metal such as gold or platinum.",
      "Electron microscopes cannot be used to observe living cells because they require a vacuum inside the microscope chamber - electrons would be scattered by air molecules. Additionally, specimen preparation for electron microscopy involves fixation with chemicals and dehydration, which kills the cells.
