    "content": "Your body contains approximately 37 trillion cells that must work together seamlessly. How do they communicate? Unlike humans using phones, cells use chemical signals—hormones, neurotransmitters, and signalling molecules—that travel through your bloodstream and bind to specific receptors. Today we explore this invisible cellular internet."

The process follows three key stages:</p><ul><li><strong>Reception:</strong> A signalling molecule (ligand) binds to a receptor protein on or in the target cell.</li><li><strong>Transduction:</strong> The binding event triggers a series of molecular relay steps, often involving second messengers like cAMP.</li><li><strong>Response:</strong> The signal reaches its target, activating specific cellular processes such as enzyme activation, protein synthesis, or changes in cell shape.</li></ul><p>Receptor proteins are highly specific—each receptor binds only to particular ligands, ensuring precise communication between cells.</p>"
