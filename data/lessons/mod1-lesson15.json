      "Three essential conditions for culturing animal cells in vitro are: (1) Sterile or aseptic conditions must be maintained to prevent contamination by bacteria or fungi, which would outcompete and kill the animal cells; (2) The temperature must be maintained at 37°C for mammalian cells, as this is the optimal temperature for enzyme function and cellular processes; (3) A 5% CO₂ atmosphere is required to maintain the correct pH (approximately 7.4) of the culture medium through the bicarbonate buffer system. Additionally, a nutrient medium containing amino acids, glucose, vitamins, and growth factors (often from fetal bovine serum) is essential for cell survival and proliferation.",
      "Primary cell cultures are derived directly from living tissue and consist of cells that have a limited lifespan, typically undergoing approximately 50 divisions (the Hayflick limit) before entering senescence (aging and stopping division). These cells are usually genetically normal (diploid) and maintain characteristics closer to cells in the living organism. In contrast, continuous cell lines are immortalised cells that have been transformed (often derived from cancer tissue or genetically modified) and can divide indefinitely in culture. While easier to maintain and providing unlimited supply for research, cell lines may be genetically abnormal (aneuploid or mutated) and may not accurately represent normal cell behaviour."
