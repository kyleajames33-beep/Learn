      "Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, which codes for a channel protein in the epithelial cell membrane. This channel normally transports chloride ions out of cells. When the CFTR protein is defective or missing, chloride ion transport is impaired. This disrupts the normal osmotic movement of water, as water normally follows the movement of ions by osmosis. Less water leaves the cells, causing the mucus outside the cells to become thick and dehydrated. This thick mucus accumulates and blocks airways, leading to breathing difficulties and frequent infections, and also blocks pancreatic ducts, causing digestive problems and malabsorption of nutrients.",
      "Cell culture technology is valuable for developing cancer treatments because it allows researchers to test the effects of potential drugs on cancer cells in vitro before testing in living organisms. This reduces the need for animal testing and improves safety for human trials. Researchers can determine cytotoxicity (cell-killing ability), measure effects on mitotic index, and screen many compounds efficiently. However, there are limitations: cells grown in 2D culture may behave differently from cells in the 3D environment of a tumour, cultured cells lack the immune system interactions present in the body, and maintaining cell lines requires technical expertise and sterile facilities. Additionally, there are ethical considerations regarding the source of some cell lines (e.g., HeLa cells and consent issues)."
