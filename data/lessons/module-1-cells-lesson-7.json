Wet mounts are ideal for viewing living cells, fresh tissues, and small aquatic organisms.</p><div class='info-box'><strong>💡 Key Concept:</strong> A good wet mount minimises air bubbles, keeps the specimen flat and thin, and prevents the sample from drying out.

ADD WATER/STAIN</h4><p>Place a small drop of water or iodine solution in the centre of a clean slide.</p><div class='examples'><strong>Iodine:</strong> Stains the nucleus and cell wall, increasing contrast so cells are easier to see.</div></div><div class='flow-arrow'>↓</div><div class='flow-box level-3'><span class='icon'>📍</span><h4>3.

Lowering the coverslip at an angle pushes air out, reducing air bubbles that can obscure cells.</p></div><div class='warning-box'><strong>🚫 Exam Trap:</strong> Do not write 'put the coverslip on top' without describing the angled lowering technique.

Transport</strong></td><td>Carry the microscope with two hands: one on the arm, one under the base.</td><td>Prevents dropping and damage to lenses and internal components.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2. Setup</strong></td><td>Place on a flat bench, plug in, and switch on light.</td><td>Stable platform prevents vibration and focus drift.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3. Start on low power</strong></td><td>Always begin with the lowest power objective (e.g. 4×).</td><td>Wider field of view makes locating specimen easier and safer.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Coarse focus first</strong></td><td>Use coarse focus only on low power.</td><td>Prevents objective from crashing into slide on high power.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5. Centre specimen</strong></td><td>Move slide so specimen is centred before increasing magnification.</td><td>Ensures specimen remains in view when FOV becomes smaller.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6. High power focus</strong></td><td>Switch to higher power and use fine focus only.</td><td>Fine focus gives sharp image without risking lens–slide contact.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>7. Clean up</strong></td><td>Lower stage, turn off light, unplug, and cover microscope.</td><td>Protects microscope and prolongs lifespan.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class='highlight-box'><strong>⚠️ Common Mistake:</strong> Never use coarse focus with the 40× or 100× objective.

It is not artwork—its purpose is to communicate scientific information.</p><div class='info-box'><strong>💡 NESA Conventions:</strong> Biological diagrams must be in pencil, use clear lines with <u>no shading</u>, include a descriptive title, have labels written horizontally in print, and show relative proportions accurately. Scale bars or magnification should be included whenever possible.</div><h3>Key Features of a Good Biological Diagram</h3><div class='table-wrap'><table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>What to Do</th><th>Why It Matters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td>Write a clear title beneath the diagram (e.g. 'Diagram of Onion Epidermis Cells').</td><td>Identifies what is shown; aligns with NESA requirement for clarity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lines</strong></td><td>Use single, sharp pencil lines. No sketching, no shading, no colouring.</td><td>Avoids confusion; emphasises structure, not artistic style.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Proportion</strong></td><td>Keep shapes in correct proportion and orientation based on what you see.</td><td>Ensures scientific accuracy; diagrams should reflect actual observation.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Labels</strong></td><td>Use straight horizontal lines (rulers) leading to structures. Labels in print, not cursive.</td><td>Improves readability and avoids overlapping lines.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scale</strong></td><td>Include magnification or scale bar where possible.</td><td>Allows others to understand actual size of structures.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Detail level</strong></td><td>Include only structures you actually observe at that magnification.</td><td>Prevents adding imagined features; maintains integrity of observations.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class='worked-example'><h4>📝 Worked Example: Onion Cell Diagram Checklist</h4><p><strong>Question:</strong> List features that must be included in a NESA-standard biological diagram of onion epidermis cells.</p><p><strong>Model answer:</strong></p><div class='step-box'><strong>1.</strong> Use a sharp HB pencil and draw single, continuous lines for cell walls—no sketching or shading.</div><div class='step-box'><strong>2.</strong> Draw several adjoining rectangular cells to show their arrangement, keeping sizes and shapes in proportion to what is seen.</div><div class='step-box'><strong>3.</strong> Add straight, horizontal label lines with a ruler, labelling: cell wall, cytoplasm, nucleus, vacuole (if visible).</div><div class='step-box'><strong>4.</strong> Write a descriptive title underneath the diagram, e.g. 'Diagram of Onion Epidermis Cells'.</div><div class='step-box'><strong>5.</strong> Include either the magnification used (e.g. 'Observed at 400×') or a scale bar with a labelled length (e.g. 50 μm).</div></div><div class='warning-box'><strong>🚫 Exam Trap:</strong> Diagrams with shading, colour, or untidy sketch lines can lose marks even if the biology is correct.

It allows anyone viewing the diagram to estimate sizes even without knowing the original magnification.</p><div class='formula-box'><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Use the magnification formula to calculate how long the scale bar should be on the page.<br><br><strong>Steps:</strong><br>1. Choose an actual length for the scale bar (e.g. 10 μm).<br>2. Multiply by magnification to find the image length (in μm or mm).<br>3. Draw a line of that length and label it (e.g. '10 μm').<br><br><strong>Example:</strong> Magnification = ×400, scale bar = 20 μm actual.<br>Image size = 20 μm × 400 = 8000 μm = 8 mm → draw an 8 mm line and label '20 μm'.</div><div class='worked-example'><h4>📝 Worked Example: Designing a Scale Bar</h4><p><strong>Question:</strong> You drew an onion cell diagram based on observations at ×400 magnification.
