However, animal cells lack a cell wall, so as water enters, the cell swells and continues to expand until the cell membrane ruptures (lysis or cytolysis). Plant cells, on the other hand, have a rigid cell wall outside the cell membrane. As water enters the plant cell, the vacuole expands and presses the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell wall resists this expansion and creates turgor pressure, which makes the cell firm and turgid. The cell wall prevents the plant cell from bursting, so it becomes turgid instead."
