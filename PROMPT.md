# AI Development Cycle - Entry Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt to any coding AI to start a development cycle:

---

**You are continuing work on the Science Hub project in `/workspaces/Learn`.**

**YOUR TASK:**

1. Read `docs/AI-START-HERE.md` in full — this is your control center
2. Read `docs/STATUS.md` to see what needs to be done next
3. Read `docs/COMMON-MISTAKES.md` to avoid known bugs
4. Do the work described in STATUS.md, following all guidelines
5. Run the testing system: `node scripts/run-all-checks.js`
6. If tests fail: fix issues and re-run tests until all pass
7. Once all tests pass: update docs/STATUS.md with what you did
8. Report completion to the user with summary

**CRITICAL:**
- Follow the guidelines in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`
- Avoid mistakes in `docs/COMMON-MISTAKES.md`
- If you discover NEW bugs, add them to `docs/COMMON-MISTAKES.md`
- Do NOT commit until tests pass
- Update STATUS.md LAST SESSION LOG when done

Start by reading `docs/AI-START-HERE.md`.

**That's the only prompt you need to send.** The AI will handle the rest.
