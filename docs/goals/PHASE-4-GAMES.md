# Phase 4: Mini-Games

**Status:** PLANNED
**Goal:** Build 8+ interactive game types that make difficult biology concepts engaging and memorable.

**Entry Criteria:** Phase 3 complete.

---

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] 8+ game types implemented
- [ ] Each game integrates with at least 2 lessons
- [ ] Games award XP and feed into progress tracking
- [ ] All games work on mobile (touch-first)
- [ ] Game scores contribute to weak area detection

## Planned Game Types

| # | Game | Concept | Mechanics |
|---|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | Mitosis Race | Cell division stages | Drag stages into correct order, timed |
| 2 | Transport Puzzle | Membrane transport | Sort molecules by transport type |
| 3 | Enzyme Kitchen | Enzyme activity | Match substrates to enzymes, adjust conditions |
| 4 | Cell Builder | Cell organelles | Drag organelles to build a functional cell |
| 5 | Microscope Lab | Microscopy skills | Adjust focus, magnification, identify specimens |
| 6 | Osmosis Challenge | Tonicity | Predict cell behaviour in different solutions |
| 7 | DNA Decoder | Genetics (future) | Transcription/translation sequence game |
| 8 | Ecosystem Balancer | Ecosystems (future) | Balance food web by adjusting populations |

## Technical Approach
- Canvas-based or DOM-based (decision deferred to Phase 4 planning)
- Game framework: none (vanilla JS, consistent with constraints)
- Touch-first input handling
- Score persistence in localStorage
- Integration point: each game links to relevant lesson content
