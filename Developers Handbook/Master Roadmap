# Science Learning Hub - Master Project Roadmap
**Project:** Interactive PWA for HSC Biology & Year 8/9 Science  
**Target Users:** NSW Students (Years 7-12)  
**Tech Stack:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, GitHub Pages, LocalStorage → Firebase  
**Current Status:** Starting Phase 00  

---

## Executive Summary
Build a progressive web app that starts as a static lesson platform (Phase 00) and evolves into an addictive, gamified learning experience (Phase 04). Each phase adds functionality without breaking previous work.

---

## Phase Overview

### PHASE 00: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal:** Working lesson platform with 3 sample lessons  
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Output:** Students can read lessons, track progress, use offline  

Core Deliverables:
- [ ] Design system implemented (Soft Ocean Breeze palette)
- [ ] PWA shell (service worker, manifest)
- [ ] Lesson template with all components
- [ ] 3 sample lessons (Module 1: Cells, Lessons 1-3)
- [ ] Progress tracking (LocalStorage)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive navigation
- [ ] Offline functionality

**Success Criteria:**
- Student can complete Lesson 1, close browser, reopen, progress persists
- Works on iPhone Safari and Chrome Android
- Lighthouse PWA score &gt;90

---

### PHASE 01: Content Core (Weeks 3-6)
**Goal:** Complete Module 1 (30 lessons) + Module overview pages  
**Dependencies:** Phase 00 complete  
**Output:** Full HSC Biology Module 1 ready for students  

Core Deliverables:
- [ ] Module 1: All 30 lessons written and formatted
- [ ] Module overview/index page
- [ ] Year level selection homepage
- [ ] Search functionality (client-side)
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation across all pages
- [ ] "Continue where you left off" feature
- [ ] Print-friendly styles

**Success Criteria:**
- All 30 lessons follow consistent template
- Student can navigate from homepage → any lesson in &lt;3 clicks
- Search returns relevant results in &lt;500ms

---

### PHASE 02: Gamification Layer (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal:** Addictive learning mechanics  
**Dependencies:** Phase 01 complete  
**Output:** Students engage daily, streaks, achievements  

Core Deliverables:
- [ ] Daily streak counter
- [ ] Achievement badges (First Lesson, Perfect Score, Speed Reader, etc.)
- [ ] XP/Level system
- [ ] Mini-games embedded in lessons:
  - Drag-and-drop labeling
  - Flashcards with spaced repetition
  - Matching games
  - Timed quizzes
- [ ] Progress dashboard (visual stats)
- [ ] Study reminders (push notifications)

**Success Criteria:**
- Student opens app 3+ days in a row (streak mechanic working)
- Mini-games load in &lt;2 seconds
- Progress dashboard shows meaningful insights

---

### PHASE 03: Social & Sync (Weeks 11-14)
**Goal:** Backend, user accounts, cross-device sync  
**Dependencies:** Phase 02 complete  
**Output:** Students can switch devices, teachers can track progress  

Core Deliverables:
- [ ] Firebase backend setup
- [ ] User authentication (email/Google)
- [ ] Cloud sync (progress follows user across devices)
- [ ] Class/teacher dashboards
- [ ] Leaderboards (opt-in)
- [ ] Collaborative features (study groups)
- [ ] Analytics for content improvement

**Success Criteria:**
- Student logs in on phone, sees same progress on laptop
- Teacher can view class progress overview
- Data backup works automatically

---

### PHASE 04: Advanced Features (Weeks 15+)
**Goal:** AI, personalisation, premium features  
**Dependencies:** Phase 03 complete  
**Output:** Adaptive learning, smart recommendations  

Core Deliverables:
- [ ] AI tutor (chatbot for questions)
- [ ] Adaptive difficulty (lessons adjust to student level)
- [ ] Personalised study plans
- [ ] Weak area detection & targeted practice
- [ ] Voice navigation
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Premium subscription (advanced features)

**Success Criteria:**
- AI answers student questions accurately 80%+ of time
- Adaptive system improves test scores vs static lessons

---

## Critical Constraints (Apply to ALL Phases)

1. **No Frameworks:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only until Phase 03
2. **Mobile First:** Every feature must work on 320px width
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JS
4. **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance minimum
5. **Performance:** First paint &lt;1.5s on 3G connection
6. **No Vendor Lock-in:** Can migrate from Firebase if needed

---

## Technical Architecture Principles

### Frontend (Phases 00-02)
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Custom Properties (design tokens)
- ES6+ Vanilla JavaScript
- Web Components (optional, Phase 02+)
- Service Workers for offline
- LocalStorage → IndexedDB (Phase 02)

### Backend (Phase 03+)
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)
- Cloud Functions for heavy processing
- Stripe for payments (Phase 04)

### Data Strategy
- Phase 00-02: Static JSON + LocalStorage
- Phase 03: Firestore with offline persistence
- Phase 04: AI/ML APIs (OpenAI, etc.)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Scope creep | Strict phase gates, NO crossing phase boundaries |
| Performance issues | Lighthouse CI checks each phase |
| Student data privacy | GDPR/privacy by design, anonymise early |
| Content accuracy | Subject matter expert review each lesson |
| Technical debt | Refactor week between phases |
