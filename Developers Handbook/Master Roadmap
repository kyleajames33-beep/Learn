### 4.3 Labeling speed challenges (timed diagram labeling)
### 4.4 Matching memory games (terminology + definitions)
### 4.5 Experiment simulator (virtual microscope, pH testing)

**Exit Criteria:** 8+ game types, each lesson has at least 1 interactive element

---

## Phase 5: Backend & Sync (Weeks 17-20)

**Goal:** Cross-device progress, teacher dashboards, data safety

### 5.1 Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)
### 5.2 Cloud sync (progress follows student across devices)
### 5.3 Storage adapter abstraction (seamless LocalStorage → Firebase switch)
### 5.4 Teacher dashboard (class progress, weak topics, completion rates)
### 5.5 Data export (PDF progress reports for parents/teachers)

**Exit Criteria:** Student logs in on phone, sees same progress on laptop. Teacher can view class overview.

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Weeks 21-24)

**Goal:** Personalization and smart learning

### 6.1 Adaptive difficulty (lessons adjust based on quiz performance)
### 6.2 Spaced repetition for flashcards (optimal review timing)
### 6.3 AI study coach (suggests what to review, encourages weak areas)
### 6.4 Voice navigation (accessibility + hands-free study)
### 6.5 Dark mode (user preference, saves battery)

**Exit Criteria:** App feels "smart" - knows what student needs before they do

---

## Phase 7: Scale & Content Expansion (Weeks 25-32)

**Goal:** Complete curriculum coverage

### 7.1 HSC Chemistry Module 1-8 (30 lessons)
### 7.2 Year 9-10 Science (Core topics, 20 lessons)
### 7.3 Year 7-8 Science (Foundation, 20 lessons)
### 7.4 Exam preparation mode (HSC past paper integration)
### 7.5 Content versioning (syllabus updates, error corrections)

**Exit Criteria:** 100+ lessons across 3 subjects, covers NSW Science 7-12

---

## Phase 8: Monetization & Sustainability (Weeks 33-36)

**Goal:** Make it a real product, not a project

### 8.1 Premium tier (advanced features, no ads, offline downloads)
### 8.2 School licenses (bulk pricing, admin controls, SSO)
### 8.3 Content marketplace (teachers can create/sell lessons)
### 8.4 Analytics dashboard (usage stats, popular content, drop-off points)
### 8.5 Community features (student forums, study groups, peer tutoring)

**Exit Criteria:** Revenue model working, sustainable development funded, active user community

---

## Phase 9: Platform Expansion (Weeks 37-44)

**Goal:** Beyond NSW, beyond web

### 9.1 National curriculum alignment (VIC, QLD, WA, SA versions)
### 9.2 Native app wrappers (iOS/Android via Capacitor/React Native)
### 9.3 Offline-first architecture (full content sync, no internet required)
### 9.4 Accessibility certification (WCAG AAA, screen reader optimized)
### 9.5 International expansion (UK GCSE, US AP Bio/Chem)

**Exit Criteria:** App store presence, works seamlessly offline, multiple countries

---

## Phase 10: Innovation & Future (Weeks 45+)

**Goal:** Cutting-edge learning technology

### 10.1 AR/VR integration (3D cell exploration, virtual labs)

## 🎯 Current Position

**Now:** Phase 0.5 (Stabilization & Optimization)  
**Next:** Phase 1 (Content Sprint - 10 more lessons)  
**Goal:** Reach Phase 1 exit (18 lessons) before school term starts  
**Estimated timeline:** 44 weeks to Phase 10 (full product)  
**Minimum viable product:** Phase 2 exit (12 weeks) - usable for HSC Biology Module 1

**Lock this roadmap. Any feature requests must map to a specific phase. No jumping ahead.**
